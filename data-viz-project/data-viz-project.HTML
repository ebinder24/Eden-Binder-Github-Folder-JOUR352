    <h1>What Did Young People Vote for in 2020?</h1>
    <h2>Which candidates and issues motivated young people during the 2020 election</h2>
    <h3>By Eden Binder</h3>
    <p>
        This takes a closer look at the candidates and issues that aligned with 
        and were of the most importance for American voters in the 18-29 age bracket who voted in the 2020 general election. 
        The first chart shows the breakdown of which candidates those who were 18-29 voted for 
        based on racial and ethnic identity. The second chart looks at some of the most important issues 
        during the election and looks at which of these issues those in the 18-29 age bracket 
        considered most important based on if they were a Biden or Trump voter.
