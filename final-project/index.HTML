    TICKFAW La. – “I just miss the memories,” Tammy, the
    60-year-old younger sister, says. They’re in the
    backyard in her favorite, shooting baskets with Daddy by
    starlight. It feels so real, she says. So precious and
    warm. “I wish I could have it all back,” she says.

</p>
            

<p>
    FIFTY MILES SOUTH AND WEST, a massive crowd is here to watch the
    older sister, to wear sequins like her, to cheer on her team.
    Five decades have passed since Kim Mulkey’s father first bounced
    a basketball to his daughters, explaining the keys to victory.
</p>

  
<p> 
    Speed. Stamina. Grit.
<p>

<p>
    Mulkey explodes at officials and is suspicious of reporters.
    Mulkey declined repeated interview requests for this story, and
    after LSU received an email from The Washington Post seeking
    comment on various elements of this story, she used two NCAA
    tournament news conferences to take aim at The Post’s reporting,
    threatening legal action in the event of “a false story.” LSU
    declined to comment.
</p>

<p>
    “Not many people are in a position to hold these kinds of
    journalists accountable,” she said. “But I am, and I’ll do it.”
</p>

<p>
    It’s by no means her first or most high-profile controversy. In
    2013, the NCAA suspended Mulkey for a tournament game after she
    criticized referees. She later publicly defended Baylor, her
    former employer, amid a sexual assault scandal in its football
    program.
</p>

<p>
    In November, she told reporters after a road game that they
    could blame her if they were sick at Thanksgiving.
</p>

<p>
    “I ain’t a sissy,” she said, holding a tissue and choking back
    sniffles. “I’ve got some kind of cold. It might be covid, but I
    ain’t testing.”
</p>

<p>
    She is also known to hold grudges and clash with players,
    including about their appearances and displays of their
    sexuality, according to interviews with former players and news
    reports. Mulkey and Brittney Griner, the coach’s biggest star at
    Baylor, have feuded for more than a decade. And while Griner’s
    294-day detainment in a Russian prison eventually required White
    House intervention, it wasn’t enough to ease tension long after
    Griner first said Mulkey encouraged gay players to hide their
    sexuality and “keep your business behind closed doors,” Griner
    wrote in her memoir.
</p>

<p>
    Mulkey, in a 2013 interview with OutSports, insisted that she
    didn’t care about players’ sexuality and wouldn’t ask them about
    it.
    
<p>
    “I don’t think it’s anybody’s business,” she said then.
    “Whoever you are. I don’t care to know that.” 
</p>
    
<p>     
    Her conflicts with  star players are over other issues too, though,
    and they have continued at LSU, even as players’ leverage and celebrity swell.
    Mulkey told a supporter last year that Angel Reese had been left
    off an awards list because of her GPA, according to email
    obtained via public records request by The Post.
</p>

<p>
    In another email, Mulkey complained that Reese was one of
    several players who “stay on that social media crap.” Mulkey is
    many things, among them a 5-foot-4 hoops whisperer, an
    exceptional teacher, a coach willing to dive deeply into
    players’ emotions to push them past their preconceived limits.
    She is also one of college basketball’s most colorful
    personalities, viewed by some as an almost cartoonishly ornery
    supervillain.

    LSU forced Iowa star Caitlin Clark to battle for every shot,
    every touch, every step. The Tigers shut off access to the lane,
    allowing Clark to be predictably lethal from long range but
    otherwise one-dimensional, enough for LSU’s blowout win and one
    achievement that eluded even Shaq and “Pistol Pete”: a national
    title. It was Mulkey’s seventh as a player or coach, and even in
    victory she was sarcastic and prickly.
</p>

<p>
    “Coaches are hollering, ‘Get off the court,’ ” Mulkey snapped
    after winning the 2023 tournament, her fourth title as a head
    coach. “And I said: ‘Don’t tell me what to do; I’m fixing to win
    another championship.’ ”
</p>

</p>

<p>
    BACK WHEN THE FOOTAGE was grainy, if it existed at all, she was
    poetry in pigtails: whirling passes behind her back, between her
    legs, past opponents. Sonja Hogg knew Louisiana Tech would be
    getting speed and grit when she recruited Mulkey, but was it too
    much to hope for more?
</p>

<p>
    “I thought maybe she’d grow a little bit,” Hogg says now.
</p>

<p>
    But Mulkey had the speed to break the press, crash the lane, lay
    it in. The smarts to recognize when a defender dropped into a
    zone before pulling up to drain one from deep. Hogg and Barmore
    freed Mulkey up to riff because she had the conditioning to let
    her ignore fatigue and continue punishing her opponents, choking
    them out, stomping the court and beaming as time expired. Tech
    won by 14, and Mulkey got hooked on winning NCAA championships
    after one taste.

<p>
    AS SOON AS LES MULKEY got out of the Marine Corps in 1963, 
    he started clearing: strawberry vines, bushes, 
    weeds and juvenile pines, even dairy cows from the playing surfaces 
    he had been imagining for six years.
</p>
            
<p>
    His father had given his two sons 25 acres to share off a highway in 
    Tangipahoa Parish. Les’s younger brother planned to raise horses on his half. 
    Les liked competition, one way to channel his overflowing energy, and 
    if all went right, he would soon be hosting weekend softball 
    tournaments and pickup basketball games. A lifelong LSU fan, he
    hoped Kim would play college basketball for the Ben-Gals, as they were 
    initially known. But when she picked Tech, he made the four-hour
    trip to Ruston for home games, slipping into the gym and fading into 
    the crowd to watch his little girl.
</p>

<p>
    “He was so proud of me,” Kim wrote, “and I was so proud that he was my dad.”
</p>
            
<p>
    Some nights, though, there were no games. Les and Dru, Kim’s mom, went dancing 
    sometimes. Other nights he would go drinking as he used to in the Corps, he says, 
    ending up in another woman’s bed. With his daughters in college, 
    Les left Dru and married another woman. She wasn’t much older than Tammy and Kim.
</p>
            
<p>
    In 1987, the WNBA was a decade away. After playing at Tech, Mulkey moved down 
    the bench as an assistant coach. And a few years after that, she wrote, her 
    boyfriend and a colleague in the athletic department, Randy Robertson, presented 
    her a jack-in-the-box with an engagement ring inside. He was popular and gregarious. 
    She hated parties and crowds, had never taken a sip of alcohol. She said yes anyway, 
    planning to toast with 7 Up at the wedding.
    Les packed his tuxedo and made the familiar drive to Ruston. 
    His new wife could attend, Kim advised, but only if she sat in the rear, 
    away from the family. The way Kim saw it, sister Tammy says, her dad hadn’t just walked 
    out on his family. He had quit on the people who depended on him, 
    the worst thing a person can do.
</p>
           
<p>
    Through her attorneys, Mulkey derided The Post for contacting family members, saying 
    they did not “relate in any way to her career.” But Mulkey herself wrote about her dad’s 
    infidelity and their estrangement in her 2007 autobiography, “Won’t Back Down.”
</p>
            
<p>
    “His unfaithfulness to my mother devastated our entire family,” she wrote.
</p>
            
<p>
    Still, Les figured, if he talked to her in person, Kim would come to her senses. 
    But she wouldn’t budge. Neither would Les. His daughter walked down the aisle alone.
    They haven’t spoken since.
</p>
            
            
<p>
    AT BAYLOR’S FIRST CONDITIONING SESSION under its new coach, 
    in the spring of 2000, forward Danielle Crockrom says, Mulkey approached and collected 
    a fistful of the exhausted player’s jersey.
</p>
            
<p>
    “Push past this point,” she says Mulkey told her, “and you’ll be an all-American.”
</p>
            
<p>
    That season, Baylor won 21 games and reached the NCAA tournament for the first time. 
    Crockrom was indeed named an all-American. The Bears lost in the first round, though, 
    and Mulkey told players this was only the beginning.
</p>
            
<p>
    “We might have raised the bar too early,” Mulkey said with a chuckle after the loss.
</p>
            
<p>
    There was more work to do, even if that meant Mulkey’s process wasn’t for everyone.
    Mulkey handed out playbooks, Crockrom says, then yanked them away. She made the team run 
    her plays again and again until calls resulted in a Pavlovian, muscle-memory response. 
    Crockrom says Mulkey made post players keep pace with guards, using structured failure 
    to push beyond physical and emotional barriers. She scheduled more and more conditioning 
    sessions, one starting earlier than the last.
</p>
            
<div class="pullquote">
    <p>
        “She’s so locked in and intense that it trickles down to everybody. And when 
        you have a whole team of people where every loose ball matters, every deflection matters, 
        every block-out, every trip down the floor — everything matters. It’s emotionally draining. 
        On the other hand, it gets results.”
    </p>

<p>
    Because know who else was up and grinding? VanDerveer at Stanford. Geno Auriemma at Connecticut. 
    Summitt at Tennessee. All were building perennial championship contenders as the women’s game 
    competed for eyeballs on the increasingly crowded sports landscape. Lisa Leslie could dunk; 
    Candace Parker could throw down against boys; Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi anchored a U-Conn. team that 
    couldn’t lose.
</p>
            
<p>
    “If you’re having a hard time with something or you’re not performing at the level that she 
    would like you to be, then get ready,” says Emily Niemann, a swing player who joined the team in 2003. 
    “Because there’s no holding back.”
</p>
            
<p>
    Niemann’s vertical jump was a mere 13 inches, and she says Mulkey brought it up constantly, instructing the 
    team not to throw Niemann a lob pass because she wouldn’t catch it. Sometimes Mulkey’s comments 
    felt like a joke, Niemann says; other times she felt humiliated. In the 2004 NCAA tournament, 
    fourth-seeded Baylor ran into Tennessee in the Sweet 16. The teams were tied as time expired, but officials 
    huddled and determined that Baylor’s Jessika Stratton had fouled Tasha Butts. After Butts made two 
    free throws, Summitt’s team advanced. Mulkey never mentioned the loss again. The team nonetheless remembered, 
    and the next season, Baylor crushed NCAA tournament opponents by an average of 15 points. 
    Niemann made five three-pointers in a title-game beatdown of Michigan State.

<p>
    AT BAYLOR, MULKEY IMPORTED a layer of trust by surrounding herself with past allies: 
    Barmore, who came out of retirement to be an assistant coach; a longtime Louisiana Tech 
    booster to oversee Baylor’s budget and travel; and a former Techsters team 
    manager to handle recruiting.
</p>
            
<p>
    Everything Mulkey did, at least as it related to basketball, worked: two Sweet 16s 
    in five years and, in 2010, another Final Four. Texas kids dreamed of wearing the green 
    and gold, and when Kelli Griffin was in seventh grade, she wrote a paper about someday 
    leaving Houston to play for Kim Mulkey.
</p>
         
<p>
    Griffin had come out in high school, but though she and Mulkey never explicitly discussed 
    her sexuality while she was being recruited, Griffin says now that it was “obvious” and 
    that she assumed Mulkey knew. She promised Griffin’s mother, Madine, that Baylor was a 
    “family” and that she would protect Kelli. Not long after Griffin arrived on campus, 
    she says, Mulkey began asking why she dressed like a boy: baggy jeans, basketball shorts, sweats. 
    A lady, Griffin says the coach told her, wears a dress. 
</p>
            
<p>
    “Okay, this lady might not like gay people,” Griffin recalls thinking.
</p>
            
<p>
    She considered transferring, but in 2008, one of Griffin’s friends and former AAU teammates 
    committed to Baylor. Brittney Griner was a 6-foot-8 phenom and YouTube dunking sensation who, 
    not long after reporting to campus, grabbed a rebound, glided the length of the court
    with the ball, then dunked it.
</p>
            
<p>
    “Dang, Kim,” Barmore said in an interview. “I think we’ve got something here.”
</p>
            
<p>
    Griner is gay, but she didn’t come out publicly until 2013, after her final game at Baylor. 
    Still, whenever Mulkey sensed Griner was distracted or stressed, Mulkey blamed “girlfriend problems,” 
    Griner later wrote, even if Griner wasn’t dating anyone.
</p>
            
<p>
    “She sounded like she was speaking a foreign language,” Griner wrote.
</p>
            
<p>
    Mulkey didn’t like the stars tattooed on Griner’s shoulders because, 
    the player later wrote, they sent the “wrong message.” Griner pacified her coach 
    by wearing a T-shirt under her jersey.
</p>
            
<p>
    “It seemed like all she cared about was the image of the program as seen through the eyes of 
    a very specific segment of the population,” Griner wrote. “Just once, 
    I wanted her to stop worrying about what everyone else thought and stand by my side.”

<p>
    IN SPRING 2016, MULKEY’S SON, who’s now 29, convinced her it was time to go see Summitt. 
    The legendary Tennessee coach, perhaps Mulkey’s dearest friend in coaching, had been diagnosed 
    with Alzheimer’s disease five years earlier.   Summitt was in a senior living facility in Knoxville, 
    and Mulkey knew what visiting her meant. Kim kept saying “I love ya,” she would tell 
    reporters later, and Pat kept saying it back. Four weeks later, Summitt was gone.
            </p>
            
<p>
    This was the same year that Baylor fired football coach Art Briles after a damning investigation 
    of the football program’s coverup of at least 17 acts of sexual or domestic assault by 19 players. 
    Mulkey went on the attack. She snapped at reporters who brought up the scandal, saying she was 
    “tired of hearing” about it, then turned a postgame speech after her 500th career win into a pulpit.
</p>
            
<p>
    “If somebody is around you and they ever say, ‘I will never send my daughter to Baylor,’ 
    you knock them right in the face,” she said. Mulkey later apologized.
</p>

</p>
                  
<p>
    The school’s leaders, many of whom had been brought in to restore the school’s reputation, 
    found themselves dealing with new headaches involving Mulkey. Even before Baylor 
    announced plans to replace the old Ferrell Center with a new arena, 
    Mulkey told peers that she expected the court to be named for her. Baylor declined 
    The Post’s requests to interview Athletic Director Mack Rhoades and school president Linda Livingstone.
    Three months after Mulkey contracted the coronavirus in 2021, forcing the cancellation of 
    a home game against U-Conn., she urged the NCAA to “dump” testing for the virus. 
    A few weeks later, Mulkey approached Baylor administrators to let them know she had an offer 
    from LSU. She planned to accept unless Baylor gave her a better deal. In a decision 
    that rocked the industry, the school made no counteroffer.
</p>
            
<p>
    ONE MONDAY MORNING IN 2022, LSU players arrived at the basketball facility and were 
    greeted with an unusual directive: Turn off your phones and put them in the other room.
    Mulkey went ballistic. Days earlier, two LSU players had gotten into a fight. 
    Teammates got between them, but the two kept at it, with spit flying and glass thrown. 
    The scene had unfolded in front of a group of visiting recruits.
</p>
            
<p>
    “My regret in this life,” one of the people present says, “I didn’t record this meeting.”
</p>
            
<p>
    That was impossible, though, because at Baylor and now at LSU, former players say, 
    staffers sometimes mitigated the risk of Mulkey’s tirades being recorded by barring 
    phones from the room. (Mulkey’s attorneys did not address this incident in their responses to The Post.)
    It had been a tense year already. Earlier in 2022, Griner, now starring for
    the Phoenix Mercury, was detained at an airport in Russia, where, 
    like many WNBA players, she supplemented her earnings by playing overseas. Officials claimed 
    she had vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage.
</p>
            
<p>
    WNBA players wore Griner’s No. 42 during the All-Star Game, and Seattle Storm player Sue Bird 
    pleaded for Griner to be released. NBA star Stephen Curry spoke out in support of Griner, 
    and President Biden signed an executive order threatening sanctions on any government 
    that wrongfully detained Americans. It was as if everyone was discussing Griner’s plight. 
    Everyone, that is, except Griner’s college coach.
</p>
            
<p>
    “And you won’t,” Mulkey shot back at a reporter who said he hadn’t seen her comment on the situation.
</p>
            
<img src=Kim-and-Griner.jpeg>

    Whatever the root of their beef, it had intensified enough that
    Mulkey would rarely say Griner’s name.  She made an exception in June 2022, 
    when Mulkey appeared on the “Tiger Rag” radio show.

    “I pray for Brittney,” Mulkey said. “I want her home safely. I think there’s lots 
    of people speaking out on her behalf, and those of us who don’t necessarily speak publicly 
    about it certainly are praying for her.”
</p>

    Still, former LSU players say, those within the program had learned to avoid mentioning Griner
    or interacting with social media posts that supported the detained player. Even in the tight
    knit coaching community, a frequent discussion topic was Mulkey’s unwillingness 
    to look beyond a grudge.

    “I really was hoping that Kim would make a statement. Really hoping she would,” says Mickie DeMoss, 
    the former Louisiana Tech player and longtime coach who adds that she considers Mulkey a friend. 
    “You’ve got a kid that’s stuck in Russia; I mean, that’s bigger than any feud that y’all had. 
    No one knew how long they were going to detain her over there.
</p>
            
<p>
    “We were all hoping [Mulkey] could just rise above it for that moment. 
    Just get her back home. But she didn’t.”
</p>
            
<p>
    Through her attorneys, Mulkey rebutted any suggestion that she failed to support Griner.
    In December 2022, after nearly a year in prison, Griner was released and returned to the 
    United States in a prisoner exchange. The basketball community expressed relief and joy,
    and reactions — not all supportive, considering the exchange freed a notorious 
    Russian arms dealer — poured out from both sides of the political aisle. Mulkey issued 
    a brief statement to ESPN: 
</p>
            
<p>
    “God is good. Prayers are powerful. Brittney is on the way home where she belongs. 
    Our prayers remain with her and her family as they recover and heal together.”
</p>

    Three months later, after Mulkey reached her fifth Final Four, a reporter asked 
    whether Mulkey had spoken with Griner. She hadn’t. Four days later, Mulkey, in a 
    pink- and gold-sequined jacket, cut down the net and held up a newspaper with 
    Reese pictured and CHAMPS! in massive letters. Even among some of Mulkey’s ex-players, 
    the enthusiasm was muted.

        “As a head coach, you’re responsible for so many people; you’re taking on a role that leaves a very
        lasting impression. You might be able to win us a championship, 
        but are people going to want to come back and see you?”

    LONG AFTER ANOTHER LSU WIN, Along the LSU baseline, families wait for Mulkey to reach them. 
    When they’ve gotten whatever they’ve been waiting for, they head toward the steps and
    a row of glass doors. As they walk, fathers tell their kids that was Kim Mulkey they just met, 
    the coach who won all those championships, told it like it is, did it all her way.

    Reporters fold their tripods and unplug their microphones from press row. 
    Athletics staffers head toward the Pete Maravich Assembly Center exits. The crowd thins, 
    and workers use a leaf blower to remove trash from empty rows.

    “Miss Kim!” a voice calls, and it echoes through the arena. Mulkey walks across the hardwood,
    sequins glinting and heels clicking, to snap another picture. Then, when they all have 
    what they wanted, the last of the friends, families and groups leave together, 
    beneath a banner marking Mulkey’s latest achievement, and the coach heads back toward the tunnel, 
    off into the evening alone.
