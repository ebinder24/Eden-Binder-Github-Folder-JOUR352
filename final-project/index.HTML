                        60-year-old younger sister, says. They’re in the
                        backyard in her favorite, shooting baskets with Daddy by
                        starlight. It feels so real, she says. So precious and
                        warm. “I wish I could have it all back,” she says.

                FIFTY MILES SOUTH AND WEST, a massive crowd is here to watch the
                older sister, to wear sequins like her, to cheer on her team.
                Five decades have passed since Kim Mulkey’s father first bounced
                a basketball to his daughters, explaining the keys to victory.

            <p id="box2">
                Mulkey explodes at officials and is suspicious of reporters.
                Mulkey declined repeated interview requests for this story, and
                after LSU received an email from The Washington Post seeking
                comment on various elements of this story, she used two NCAA
                tournament news conferences to take aim at The Post’s reporting,
                threatening legal action in the event of “a false story.” LSU
                declined to comment.
            </p>

            <p id="box3">
                “Not many people are in a position to hold these kinds of
                journalists accountable,” she said. “But I am, and I’ll do it.”
            </p>

            <p id="box4">
                It’s by no means her first or most high-profile controversy. In
                2013, the NCAA suspended Mulkey for a tournament game after she
                criticized referees. She later publicly defended Baylor, her
                former employer, amid a sexual assault scandal in its football
                program.
            </p>

            <p id="box5">
                In November, she told reporters after a road game that they
                could blame her if they were sick at Thanksgiving.
            </p>

            <p id="box6">
                “I ain’t a sissy,” she said, holding a tissue and choking back
                sniffles. “I’ve got some kind of cold. It might be covid, but I
                ain’t testing.”
            </p>

            <p id="box7">
                She is also known to hold grudges and clash with players,
                including about their appearances and displays of their
                sexuality, according to interviews with former players and news
                reports. Mulkey and Brittney Griner, the coach’s biggest star at
                Baylor, have feuded for more than a decade. And while Griner’s
                294-day detainment in a Russian prison eventually required White
                House intervention, it wasn’t enough to ease tension long after
                Griner first said Mulkey encouraged gay players to hide their
                sexuality and “keep your business behind closed doors,” Griner
                wrote in her memoir.
            </p>

            <p id="box8">
                Mulkey, in a 2013 interview with OutSports, insisted that she
                didn’t care about players’ sexuality and wouldn’t ask them about
                it. “I don’t think it’s anybody’s business,” she said then.
                “Whoever you are. I don’t care to know that.” Her conflicts with
                star players are over other issues too, though, and they have
                continued at LSU, even as players’ leverage and celebrity swell.
                Mulkey told a supporter last year that Angel Reese had been left
                off an awards list because of her GPA, according to email
                obtained via public records request by The Post.
            </p>

            <p id="box9">
                In another email, Mulkey complained that Reese was one of
                several players who “stay on that social media crap.” Mulkey is
                many things, among them a 5-foot-4 hoops whisperer, an
                exceptional teacher, a coach willing to dive deeply into
                players’ emotions to push them past their preconceived limits.
                She is also one of college basketball’s most colorful
                personalities, viewed by some as an almost cartoonishly ornery
                supervillain.

            <p id="box10">
                LSU forced Iowa starCaitlin Clark to battle for every shot,
                every touch, every step. The Tigers shut off access to the lane,
                allowing Clark to be predictably lethal from long range but
                otherwise one-dimensional, enough for LSU’s blowout win and one
                achievement that eluded even Shaq and “Pistol Pete”: a national
                title. It was Mulkey’s seventh as a player or coach, and even in
                victory she was sarcastic and prickly.
            </p>

            <p id="box11">
                “Coaches are hollering, ‘Get off the court,’ ” Mulkey snapped
                after winning the 2023 tournament, her fourth title as a head
                coach. “And I said: ‘Don’t tell me what to do; I’m fixing to win
                another championship.’ ”
            </p>

            <p id="box12">
                BACK WHEN THE FOOTAGE was grainy, if it existed at all, she was
                poetry in pigtails: whirling passes behind her back, between her
                legs, past opponents. Sonja Hogg knew Louisiana Tech would be
                getting speed and grit when she recruited Mulkey, but was it too
                much to hope for more?
            </p>

            <p id="box13">
                “I thought maybe she’d grow a little bit,” Hogg says now.
            </p>

            <p id="box14">
                But Mulkey had the speed to break the press, crash the lane, lay
                it in. The smarts to recognize when a defender dropped into a
                zone before pulling up to drain one from deep. Hogg and Barmore
                freed Mulkey up to riff because she had the conditioning to let
                her ignore fatigue and continue punishing her opponents, choking
                them out, stomping the court and beaming as time expired. Tech
                won by 14, and Mulkey got hooked on winning NCAA championships
                after one taste.
